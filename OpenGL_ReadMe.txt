This second project is an implementation of OpenGL using C++. The implementation was done by following an online course where I learned about how to write clean
and efficient C++ code as well as the background needed to operate OpenGL. At the end of it I obtained a deep understanding of many of the basics behind graphics 
programming from Vertex Buffers and Shaders to Textures and Model View Projections. The end result is an abstracted framework that can be used to implement future 
testing in graphics design.

After completing the framework, I applied my own Steering component to a basic sprite to showcase different the pathing techniques of Chasing, Fleeing, and Wandering.

To run the program:

OpenGL -> OpenGL -> locate and run the OpenGL.exe application

If you are missing any dll files after running the application, you may have to install the latest SDK for windows 10.
Installing Visual Studios will also correct the issue by giving you the latest redistributable for Visual C++
